# Rubiks_Cube
Description:
Developed a fully functional 3x3 Rubikâ€™s Cube simulator and solver using **JavaScript** with an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach. The project includes manual side rotation, random scrambling, and a step-by-step **layer-by-layer (beginner's method)** solving algorithm. It visually represents each step using a custom rendering function and shows the cube's state after every move.

Key Features:

* Object-oriented representation of all six cube faces and their pieces.
* Manual and algorithmic cube rotations, including adjacent sticker movement.
* Random scramble generation to simulate unsolved cube states.
* Simplified layer-by-layer solving logic that demonstrates real solving steps.
* Cube state visualized using HTML/CSS with color-coded 2D grid representation.
* Clean separation of logic (JavaScript), visuals (HTML), and styles (CSS).

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript(ES6+), DOM manipulation, basic algorithm design
